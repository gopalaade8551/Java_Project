package P_37_Abstract_class;


/*
Abstract class:
---------------
Abstract class is a class which can contain the abstract methods and is defined with the keyword abstract.

Abstract class contains abstract methods and non abtract methods.
we cannot create instance of the abstract class due to the abstract class contains abstract methods

when to use:
when there is common implementation between multiple classes,then we will place that common implementation in a abstract class or when you feel that you cannot provide the complete implementation then create abstract class and 
provide the implementation how much you can.


abstract class provides the partial impelentation of  the interface and remaining things will kept as a abstract methods	
abstract class came into the picture before java 8



imp:
----
interface does not provides the implementation and abstract class provides the implementation of the methods but not fully partial implementation.

Abstract class provides the common implemetation of the methods which can be used by other classes by extending that abstract class
